		  // This is our Angular app module (modules are containers for the various parts of an Angular app). We named our app kittiesApp, and will bootstrap it in index.html with the ng-app directive. The empty array means that this module doesn't depend on any other modules (if it did, we'd list them there). Only one app module is permitted, so kittiesApp is it.
